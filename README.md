# Continual‑Learning LLM Fine‑Tuning

**By Krishna Chaitanya**

> “Can we teach a small language model two different conversational styles in sequence, and have it remember the first style after learning the second?”

This solution walks through a complete, CPU‑friendly pipeline that addresses this question using two interview datasets: first Lee Cronin with Lex Fridman, then Lisa Randall with Lex Fridman. We apply parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning followed by continual‑learning techniques to preserve the original conversational style, quantifying forgetting with perplexity measurements.

---

## 1. Motivation & Overview

We set out to build an LLM training workflow that can:

1. **Learn one conversational style** (Lee Cronin ↔ Lex Fridman)
2. **Then learn a second style** (Lisa Randall ↔ Lex Fridman)

**Goal:** Ensure the model does not lose the ability to generate the first style after sequential training.

**Approach combines:**

* **LoRA adapters** for efficient parameter‑light fine‑tuning.
* **Replay buffer** of previous data mixed with **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** to protect important weights.
* **Perplexity-based evaluation** on held‑out original data before and after Phase 2 to measure forgetting.

These steps create a stable pipeline usable on modest hardware (CPU-only, 16 GB RAM).

---

## 2. Data & Exploratory Analysis

We work with two CSV files, each containing alternating dialogue lines and speaker labels:

* **Dataset 1:** 791 utterances between Lee Cronin and Lex Fridman.
* **Dataset 2:** 219 utterances between Lisa Randall and Lex Fridman.

**Key exploration steps included:**

1. **Speaker normalization:** Standardized speaker names and introduced special tokens (`<LEX>`, `<LEE>`, `<LISA>`) so the model explicitly knows who is speaking.
2. **Utterance length analysis:** Examined character and token length distributions and found over 95 % of lines were under 100 tokens, enabling efficient batching without truncation.
3. **Balance check:** Verified no speaker exceeds 60 % of total turns, avoiding severe class imbalance.
4. **Quality inspection:** Confirmed there were no missing values, reviewed shortest/longest lines for formatting issues, and estimated vocabulary sizes (\~3 035 unique tokens for Lee, \~1 409 for Lisa).

*These insights guided tokenizer settings and hyperparameter choices for subsequent fine‑tuning.*

---

## 3. Model & Tokenizer Configuration

We selected **DistilGPT‑2** (≈82 M parameters), a causal language model that runs comfortably on a single CPU. Then we:

* **Extended the tokenizer** to include a dedicated `[PAD]` token and our speaker tokens (`<LEX>`, `<LEE>`, `<LISA>`), ensuring clear speaker signals.
* **Resized model embeddings** to accommodate the new tokens without discarding pretrained weights.
* **Fixed max sequence length** at 100 tokens, covering the majority of dialogue turns without wasted compute.

*This setup provided a solid base for both phases of fine‑tuning.*

---

## 4. Phase 1: LoRA Adapter Fine‑Tuning on Lee Cronin ↔ Lex Fridman

In the first phase, we taught the model to generate both Lee’s and Lex’s lines. Instead of updating all model weights, we injected **LoRA** modules into GPT‑2’s attention and projection layers. By training only these small, rank‑reduced matrices, we kept the trainable parameter count under one million, reducing memory use and enabling quick iteration.

**After one epoch on the Lee Cronin data:**

* **Trainable LoRA parameters:** 811 008
* **Validation loss:** 4.8207 → **Perplexity ≈ 124.3**

**After two epochs + linear LR decay (10% warmup):**

* **Validation loss:** 4.5505 → **Perplexity ≈ 94.7**
* **Relative improvement:** \~24% reduction in perplexity (124.3→94.7)

**Sample generation:**

```
<LEE> How would you approach cross-coupling for this substrate?
Model → “A Suzuki coupling using Pd(PPh₃)₄ under inert argon, followed by silica chromatography…”
```

This demonstrates that the adapter captures Lee Cronin’s conversational patterns effectively.

## 5. Phase 2: Continual Learning on Lisa Randall ↔ Lex Fridman

Sequential fine‑tuning risks **catastrophic forgetting**. To balance **plasticity** (learning Lisa’s style) and **stability** (retaining Lee’s), we combined two methods:

1. **Replay Buffer:** Randomly sampled 10 % of the Lee Cronin data and interleaved it with the Lisa data during Phase 2 training, rehearsing original knowledge.
2. **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC):** Computed the diagonal of the Fisher Information Matrix on replay examples to estimate parameter importance for Phase 1. Added a penalty term $\lambda \sum_i F_i(\theta_i - \theta^*_i)^2$ to discourage changing critical weights, where $\lambda$ controls penalty strength.

We experimented with different $\lambda$ values and replay proportions, finding $\lambda=10$ with 10 % replay best minimized forgetting.

---

## 6. Measuring Forgetting with Perplexity

We evaluated perplexity on the held‑out Lee Cronin test set **before** and **after** Phase 2 under three training configurations:

1. **Phase 1 = 1 epoch; Phase 2 = 1 epoch**

   * **Baseline PPL:** ≈ 97.8
   * **After P2 PPL:** ≈ 105.6
   * **Forgetting:** +8.0 %

2. **Phase 1 = 2 epochs + linear decay; Phase 2 = 1 epoch**

   * **Baseline PPL:** ≈ 92.7
   * **After P2 PPL:** ≈ 100.24
   * **Forgetting:** +8.1 %

3. **Phase 1 = 2 epochs + linear decay; Phase 2 = 2 epochs**

   * **Baseline PPL:** ≈ 90.25
   * **After P2 PPL:** ≈ 96.94
   * **Forgetting:** +7.4 %

> **Interpretation:**
>
> * Adding a second epoch to Phase 1 alone yields a stronger base (PPL 92.7 → 90.25) but similar forgetting when Phase 2 is 1 epoch (+8.1 %).
> * Increasing Phase 2 to 2 epochs further reduces forgetting to **+7.4 %**, demonstrating that additional Phase 2 training can reclaim some of the original style performance.
> * The final post‑Phase 2 PPL is lowest in the 2×2 setup (96.94 vs. 100.24 and 105.6), indicating the best overall retention and adaptation trade‑off.

*These results underscore how tuning both Phase 1 and Phase 2 epoch counts can optimize stability vs. plasticity on CPU‑only hardware.*

\--- the complex stability–plasticity trade-off: stronger Phase 1 models require careful Phase 2 tuning to preserve gains.\*

\--- % rise for the 1‑epoch setup demonstrates a strong stability–plasticity trade-off given CPU-only constraints.\*

An 8 % rise represents modest forgetting given our single-epoch, CPU-only budget, demonstrating a strong stability–plasticity trade-off.

## 7. Future Research Directions

To push the boundaries of continual learning and further reduce forgetting, several advanced methods could be explored in future work:

### 7.1 Learning without Forgetting (LwF)

* **Concept:** Use the model’s own Phase 1 outputs (soft logits) on Lee Cronin examples as auxiliary targets during Phase 2, alongside the hard labels for Lisa Randall.
* **Pros:** No need to store actual old data; soft targets carry rich information about original predictions.
* **Cons:** Requires careful balancing between hard and soft losses; noisy soft labels may slow convergence.

### 7.2 Synaptic Intelligence (SI)

* **Concept:** Compute a running estimate of each parameter’s importance during Phase 1 training (based on weight changes and loss gradients), then penalize changes to important weights during Phase 2.
* **Pros:** Online computation avoids separate Fisher estimation; lightweight memory footprint.
* **Cons:** Importance estimates can drift if Phase 1 is very short; hyperparameters (e.g., damping) need tuning.

### 7.3 Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM & AGEM)

* **Concept:** Maintain a small memory of Phase 1 examples; at each Phase 2 update, solve a constrained optimization so that the loss on memory does not increase.
* **Pros:** Guarantees no forgetting on stored examples; effective at preserving performance.
* **Cons:** Requires solving a quadratic program or projection per update—computationally expensive on CPU.

### 7.4 Generative Replay

* **Concept:** Train a compact generative model to reproduce representative Lee Cronin utterances; sample pseudo-experiences from it during Phase 2 instead of storing raw data.
* **Pros:** No need for raw data storage; the generator can compress information about past tasks.
* **Cons:** Quality of pseudo-data depends on generator fidelity; adds complexity by introducing a second model.

### 7.5 Progressive Networks

* **Concept:** Freeze the Phase 1 LoRA adapters and base weights, then allocate new adapters for Phase 2. Lateral connections allow information flow between old and new modules.
* **Pros:** Zero interference with Phase 1 parameters; strong transfer potential through feature reuse.
* **Cons:** Parameter growth is linear with number of tasks; increases inference cost over time.

### 7.6 Adapter Fusion

* **Concept:** Train separate LoRA adapters for each speaker style and then learn a small fusion network that dynamically weights their contributions at inference time.
* **Pros:** Enables mixing of multiple styles; adapters remain modular and reusable.
* **Cons:** Requires additional trainable fusion parameters; fusion strategy must be learned carefully.

### 7.7 Meta‑Learning for Continual Learning

* **Concept:** Use meta-optimization (e.g., MAML-style) to find initial weights or adapter configurations that are robust to sequential fine-tuning.
* **Pros:** Can yield models that require minimal adaptation steps per new style; potential for one-shot style acquisition.
* **Cons:** Adds a costly meta-training loop; stability of meta-objective on CPU may be challenging.

> Exploring these methods in ablation studies would deepen our understanding of the stability–plasticity trade-offs and guide the design of even more robust, CPU-friendly continual-learning pipelines.

## 8. Hyperparameter Tuning & Best Practices

Fine-tuning performance and retention can often be improved by thoughtful hyperparameter adjustments. Below are several parameters you might consider increasing or tuning, especially if you have extra time or hardware headroom:

* **Number of Epochs:**

  * **Current:** 1 epoch per phase.
  * **Recommendation:** Increasing to 2–3 epochs can allow the model to refine both styles more deeply. Monitor validation loss to avoid overfitting or excessive forgetting.

* **Learning Rate Schedule:**

  * **Current:** Fixed LR of 2×10⁻⁴.
  * **Recommendation:** Use a **linear decay** or **cosine schedule** with warmup (e.g., 10–20% of steps) to stabilize early training and lower the LR gradually toward later epochs.

* **Gradient Accumulation / Batch Size:**

  * **Current:** Batch size 2 with 16× gradient accumulation (effective 32).
  * **Recommendation:** If memory allows, increase effective batch size (e.g., accumulation 32, effective 64) to smooth gradient estimates, improving convergence and reducing noise in EWC penalty.

* **LoRA Rank & Dropout:**

  * **Current:** rank=16, dropout=0.05.
  * **Recommendation:** Test higher rank values (e.g., 32 or 64) to capture more nuanced style features, and tune dropout (0.1–0.2) to prevent adapter overfitting, especially on small datasets.

* **EWC Penalty Strength & Replay Ratio:**

  * **Current:** λ=10, replay=10%.
  * **Recommendation:** For stronger stability, you can increase λ (up to 20) or replay buffer size (15–20%). However, larger EWC penalties may slow learning of the new style, so balance accordingly.

* **Early Stopping & Checkpointing:**

  * Use **early stopping** on validation loss to prevent unnecessary epochs, and **save\_total\_limit** to retain only top-K checkpoints, preserving storage.

> By iteratively tuning these parameters and observing both style fidelity and forgetting metrics, you can further optimize the stability–plasticity trade-off. Always track against a held-out validation set for each phase.
