0,lex fridman, the following is a conversation with lisa randall a theoretical physicist and cosmologist at harvard her work involves improving our understanding of particle physics supersymmetry baryogenesis cosmological inflation and dark matter
1,lex fridman, this is the lex friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description now dear friends heres lisa randall
2,lex fridman,dark matter
3,lex fridman, one of the things you work on and write about is dark matter we cant see it but theres a lot of it in the universe you also end one of your books with a beatles song quote got to be goodlooking because hes so hard to see what is dark matter how should we think about it given that we cant see it how should we visualize it in our minds eye
4,lisa randall, i think one of the really important things that physics teaches you is just our limitations but also our abilities the fact that we can deduce the existence of something that we dont directly see is really a tribute to people that we can do that its also something that tells you you cant overly rely on your direct senses if you just relied on just what you see directly you would miss so much of whats happening in the world
5,lisa randall, we can generalize this but just for now to focus on dark matter its something we know is there and its not just one way we know its there in my book dark matter and the dinosaurs i talk about the many different ways theres eight or nine that we deduce not just the existence of dark matter but how much is there and they all agree
6,lisa randall, now how do we know its there because of its gravitational force individually a particle doesnt have such a big gravitational force in fact gravity is an extremely weak force compared to other forces we know about in nature but theres a lot of dark matter out there it carries a lot of energy five times the amount of energy as the matter we know thats in atoms et cetera
7,lisa randall, you can ask how should we think about it its just another form of matter that doesnt interact with light or at least as far as we know it interacts gravitationally it clumps it forms galaxies but it doesnt interact with light which means we just dont see it most of our detection before gravitational wave detectors we only saw things because of their interactions with light in some sense
8,lex fridman, in theory it behaves just like any other matter it just doesnt interact with light
9,lisa randall, when we say it interacts just like any other form of matter we have to be careful because gravitationally it interacts like other forms of matter but it doesnt experience electromagnetism which is why it has a different distribution
10,lisa randall, in our galaxy its roughly spherical unless it has its own interactions thats another story we know that its roughly spherical whereas ordinary matter can radiate and clumps into a disk thats why we see the milky way disk on large scales in some sense yes all the matter is similar in some sense
11,lisa randall, in fact dark matter is in some sense more important because it can collapse more readily than ordinary matter because ordinary matter has radiative forces which makes it hard to collapse on small scales actually its dark matter that drives galaxy formation and then ordinary matter comes along with it
12,lisa randall, theres also just more of it and because theres more of it can start collapsing sooner that is to say the energy density in dark matter dominates over radiation earlier than you would if you just had an ordinary matter
13,lex fridman, its part of the story of the origin of the galaxy part of the story of the end of the galaxy and part of the story of all the various interactions throughout
14,lisa randall, exactly in my book i make jokes about its like when we think about a building we think about the architect we think about the high level but we forget about all the workers that did all the grunt work in fact dark matter was really important in the formation of our universe and we forget that sometimes
15,lex fridman, thats a metaphor on top of a metaphor okay the unheard voices that do the actual work
16,lisa randall, exactly no but it is a metaphor but it also captures something because the fact is we dont directly see it so we forget its there or we dont understand its there or we think its not the fact that we dont see it makes it no less legitimate it just means that we have challenges in order to find out exactly what it is
17,lex fridman, yeah but the things we cannot see that nevertheless have a gravitational interaction with the things we cant see is at the layman level its just mindblowing
18,lisa randall, it is and it isnt because i think what its teaching us is that were human the universe is what it is and were trying to interact with that universe and discover what it is weve discovered amazing things
19,lisa randall, in fact i would say its more surprising that the matter that we know about is constitutes as big a fraction of the universe as it does were limited were human the fact that we see  of the energy density of the universe about one sixth of the energy density in matter thats remarkable why should that be anything could be out there yet the universe that we see is a significant fraction
20,lex fridman, yeah but a lot of our intuition i think operates using visualizations in the mind
21,lisa randall, thats absolutely true certainly writing books i realized also how many of our words are based on how we see the world and thats true thats actually one of the fantastic things about physics is that it teaches you how to go beyond your immediate intuition to develop intuitions that apply at different distances different scales different ways of thinking about things
22,lex fridman, yeah how do you anthropomorphize dark matter
23,lisa randall, i just did i think i made it the grunt workers
24,lex fridman, oh yeah thats good you did thats why you get paid the big bucks and write the great books okay you also write in that book about dark matter having to do something with the extinction events the extinction of the dinosaurs which is a fascinating presentation of how everything is connected
25,lex fridman, i guess the disturbances from the dark matter they create gravitational disturbances in the oort cloud at the edge of our solar system and then that increases the rate of asteroids hitting earth
26,lisa randall, i want to be really clear this was a speculative theory
27,lex fridman, i love it though
28,lisa randall, i liked it too we still dont know for sure but what we liked about it let me take a step back we usually assume that dark matter we being physicists that its just one thing its just basically noninteracting aside from gravity or very weakly interacting matter
29,lisa randall, again we have to get outside this mindset of just humans and ask what else could be there what we suggested is that theres a fraction of dark matter not all the dark matter but some of the dark matter maybe it has interactions of its own just the same way in our universe we have lots of different types of matter we have nuclei we have electrons we have neutrons we have forces
30,lisa randall, its not a simple model the standard model but it does have some basic ingredients so maybe dark matter also has some interesting structure to it maybe theres some small fraction the interesting thing is that if some of the dark matter does radiate and i like to call it dark light because its light that we dont see but dark matter would see it could radiate that and then it could perhaps collapse into a disk the same way ordinary matter collapsed into the milky way disk
31,lisa randall, its not all the dark matter its a fraction but it could conceivably be a very thin disk of dark matter thin dense disk of dark matter the question is do these exist people have done studies now to think about whether they can find them its an interesting target its something you can measure by measuring the positions and velocities of stars you can find out what the structure of the milky way is but the fun proposal was that the solar system orbits around the galaxy
32,lisa randall, as it does so it goes a little bit up and down kind of horses on a carousel the suggestion was every time it goes through you have an enhanced probability that you would dislodge something from the edge of the solar system in something called the oort cloud the idea was that at those times youre more likely to have these cataclysmic events such as the amazing one that actually caused the last extinction that we know of for sure
33,lex fridman, it wasnt so amazing for the dinosaurs
34,lisa randall, or for two thirds of the species on the planet
35,lex fridman, but it gets amazing for humans it wouldnt be
36,lisa randall, what really is amazing i talk about this in dark matter and the dinosaurs it is just an amazing scientific story because it really is one of the real stories that combine together different fields of science geologists at the time or people thought that things happen slowly and this would be a cataclysmic event
37,lisa randall, also i have to say if you think about it it sounds like a story a fiveyearold would make up maybe the dinosaurs were killed by some big rock that came and hit the earth but then there really was a scientific story behind it thats also why i like the dark disk because theres a scientific story behind it as farfetched as it might sound you could actually go and look for the experimental consequences for the observational consequences to test whether its true
38,lex fridman, i wish you could know highresolution details of where that asteroid came from where in the oort cloud why it happened is it in fact because of dark matter just the full tracing back to the origin of the universe because humans seem to be somewhat special it seems like so many fascinating events at all scales of physics had to happen for inaudible 
39,lisa randall, im really really glad you mentioned that because actually that was one of the main points of my book dark matter and the dinosaurs one of the reasons i wrote it was because i really think we are abusing the planet were changing the planet way too quickly just like anything else when you alter things its good to think about the history of what it took to get here
40,lisa randall, as you point out it took many operations on many different scales we had to have the formation of structure the formation of galaxies the formation of the solar system the formation of our planet the formation of humans theres so many steps that go into this humans in some part were the result of the fact that this big object hit the earth made the dinosaurs go extinct and mammals developed it is an incredible story and yes something else might come of it but it wont be us if we mess with it too much
41,lex fridman, but it is on a grand scale earth is a pretty resilient system can you just clarify just fascinating the shape of things the shape of the milky ways of the observable stuff is mostly flat you said dark matter tends to be spherical but a subset of that might be a flat disk
42,lisa randall, you want to hear about the shape of things
43,lex fridman, yes please
44,lisa randall, structure formed early on and now our structure that we live in is we know about the milky way galaxy the milky way galaxy has the disk you can see in a dry dark place thats where stars and light is but you can also measure in some ways the dark matter we believe that dark matter is more or less spherically distributed like we said theres a lot of it not necessarily in the disk but just because its a sphere theres a lot of it sitting there
45,lisa randall, the reason it doesnt collapse as far as we know is that it cant radiate the same way because it can radiate ordinary matter collapses and this actually because of conservation of angular momentum it stays a disk and it doesnt just collapse to the center our suggestion was that maybe there are some components of dark matter that also radiate
46,lisa randall, like i said thats far from proven people have looked for a disk they see some evidence of some disks of certain densities but these are all questions that are worth asking basically if we can figure it out from existing measurements why not try
47,lex fridman, okay so not all dark matter is made the same
48,lisa randall, thats a possibility we actually dont know what dark matter is in the first place we dont know what most of it is we dont know what a fraction is its hard to measure why is it hard to measure for exactly the reason you said earlier we dont see it we want to think of possibilities for what it can be especially if those give rise to some observational consequences its a tough game because its not something thats just there for the taking you have to think about what it could be and how you might find it
49,lex fridman, the way you detect it is gravitational effects on things we can see
50,lisa randall, that would be the way you detect the type of dark matter ive been talking about people have suggestions for other forms of dark matter they could be particles called axions they could be other types of particles and then there are different ways of detecting it
51,lisa randall, the most popular candidate for dark matter probably until pretty recently because they havent found it is something called wimps weakly interacting massive particles particles that have mass about the same as the higgs boson mass and it turns out then you would get about the right density of dark matter
52,lisa randall, people really like that of course because it is connected to the standard model the particles that we know about and if its connected to that we have a better chance of actually seeing it fortunately or unfortunately its also a better chance that you can rule it out because you can look for it so far no one has found it were still looking for
53,lex fridman, is that one of the hopes of the large hadron collider
54,lisa randall, that was originally one of the hopes of large hadron collider id say at this point it would be very unlikely given what theyve already accomplished but there are these underground detectors xenon detectors that look for dark matter coming in and they are going to try to achieve a much stronger bound than exists today
55,lex fridman, just to take that tangent looking back now whats the biggest to you insight to humanity that the lhc has been able to provide
56,lisa randall, its interesting its both a major victory the higgs boson was proposed  years ago and it was discovered the higgs mechanism seemed to be the only way to explain elementary particle masses and it was right so on the one hand it was a major victory on the other hand ive been in physics long enough to know it was also a cautionary tale in some sense because at the time i started out in physics we had proposed something in the united states called the superconducting supercollider
57,lisa randall, a lot of physicists ill say particularly in europe but id say a lot of physicists were saying when that the large hadron collider would have the energy reach necessary to discover what underlies the standard model we dont want to just discover the standard model we want to know what the next step is
58,lisa randall, i think here people were more cautious about that they want to have a more comprehensive search that could get to higher energies more events so that we could really more definitively rule it out in that case many people thought they knew what would be there it happened to be a theory called supersymmetry a lot of physicists thought it would be supersymmetry
59,lisa randall, its one of the many factors i think that went into the fact that the large hadron collider became the only machine in town and the superconducting supercollider wouldve just been a much if it had really had achieved what it was supposed to wouldve been a much more robust test of the space
60,lisa randall, id say for humanity its both a tribute to the ability of discovery and the ability of really believing in things so that you have the confidence to go look for them but its also a cautionary tale that you dont want to assume things before theyve been actually found you want to believe in your theories but you also want to question them at the same time in ways that youre more likely to discover the truth
61,lex fridman, its also an illustration of grand engineering efforts that humanity can take on and maybe a lesson that you could go even bigger
62,lisa randall, im really glad you said that though too because thats absolutely true it really is an impressive its impressive in so many ways its impressive technologically its impressive at engineering level
63,lisa randall, its also impressive that so many countries work together to do this it wasnt just one country it was also impressive in that it was a longterm project that people committed to and made it happen it is a demonstration that when people set their minds to things and they commit to it that they can do something amazing
64,lex fridman, also in the united states maybe a lesson that bureaucracy can slow things down to inaudible 
65,lisa randall, bureaucracy and politics
66,lex fridman, politics
67,lisa randall, and economics many things can make them faster and make them slower
68,lex fridman, science is the way to make progress politics is the way to slow that progress down and here we are
69,lisa randall, i dont want to overstate that because without politics the inaudible  wouldnt happen either
70,lex fridman, you need broccoli
71,lisa randall, sometimes i do think youre not asking this question but sometimes i do think when i think about some of these conflicts sometimes its just good to have a project that people work on together there were some efforts to do that in science too to have palestinians and israelis work together a project called sesame i think its not a bad idea when you can do that when you can get forget the politics and just focus on some particular project sometimes that can work
72,lex fridman, some kind of forcing function some kind of deadline that gets people to sit in a room together and youre working on a thing as part of that you realize the common humanity that you all have the same concerns the same hopes the same fears that you are all human thats an accidental side effect of working together on a thing
73,lisa randall, thats absolutely true its one of the reasons cern was formed actually it was postworld war ii and a lot of european physicists had actually left europe and they wanted to see europeans work together and rebuild and it worked they did its true i often think that that one of the major problems is we just dont meet enough people so that everyone when they seem like the other its more easy to forget their humanity i think it is important to have these connections
74,lisa randall,extinction events
75,lex fridman, given the complexity all cosmological scales involved here that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs when you look out at the future of earth do you worry about future extinction events
76,lisa randall, i do think that we might be in the middle of an extinction right now if you define it by the number of species that are getting killed off its subtle but its a complex system the way things respond to events is sometimes things evolve sometimes animals just move to another place the way weve developed the earth its very hard for species just to move somewhere else
77,lisa randall, were seeing that with people now too i know people are worried just about ai taking over and thats a totally different story we just dont think about the future very much we think about what were doing now and we certainly dont think enough about all the animals that were destroying all the things that are precursors to humans that we rely on
78,lex fridman, its interesting to think whether the things that threaten us is the stuff we see thats happening gradually or the stuff we dont really see thats going to happen all of a sudden i sometimes think about what should we be worried about it seems like with the asteroids or nuclear war it could be stuff that just happens one day when i say one day meaning over a span of a few days or a few months but not on a scale of decades and centuries we sometimes mostly talk about stuff thats happening gradually but we can be really surprised
79,lisa randall, its actually really interesting that was actually one of the reasons it took a while to determine what it was that it caused the last extinction because people did think at the time many people thought that things were more gradual and the idea of extinction was actually a novel concept at some point
80,lisa randall, these arent predictable events necessarily theyre only predictable on a grand scale but sometimes they are i think people were pretty aware that nuclear weapons were dangerous im not sure people are as aware now as they were say  or  years ago and that certainly worries me i have to say i was not as worried about ai as other people but now i understand its more that as soon as you create things that we lose control over its scary
81,lisa randall, the other thing that were learning from the events today is that it takes a few bad actors it takes everyone to make things work well it takes not that many things to make things go wrong the issue with disease we can find out what causes a disease but to make things better is not necessarily that simple sometimes it is but for things to be healthy a lot of things have to work for things to go wrong only one thing has to go wrong its amazing that we do it
82,lisa randall, the same is true for democracy for democracy to work a lot of people have to believe in it a few bad actors can destroy things sometimes a lot of the things that we really rely on are delicate equilibrium situations there is some robustness in the systems we try to build in robustness but a few extreme events can sometimes alter things i think thats what people are scared of today in many ways theyre scared of it for democracy theyre scared of it for peace theyre scared of it for ai
83,lisa randall, i think theyre not as scared as they should be about nuclear weapons to be honest i think thats more serious danger than people realize i think people are a little bit more scared about pandemics than they were before but i still say theyre not super scared about it so youre right there are these major events that can happen and we are setting things up so that they might happen and we should be thinking about them the question is who should be thinking about them how should we be thinking about them how do you make things happen on a global scale because thats really what we need
84,lex fridman, it certainly shouldnt be a source of division it should be a source of grand collaboration probably
85,lisa randall, wouldnt that be nice
86,lex fridman, yeah i just wonder what itd be like to be a dinosaur it must have been beautiful to look at that asteroid enter the atmosphere until everything man that would be one of the things i would travel back in time to just to watch it
87,lisa randall, thats also one of the things that i think you probably could do with virtual reality i dont think you have to be there and get extinct
88,lex fridman, to just experience it
89,lisa randall, i think theres something its an event youre just watching youre not doing anything youre just looking at it so maybe you could just recreate it
90,lex fridman, i actually heard that theres a nuclear weapon explosion experience in virtual reality thats good to remind you about what it would feel like
91,lisa randall, i have to say i got an award from the museum of nuclear history and technology in the southwest and i went to visit the museum which turned out to be mostly a museum of nuclear weapons the scary thing is that they look really cool
92,lisa randall, its true that you have that yes this is scary but you also have this is cool feeling and i think we have to get around that because i think that yes you can be in that but im not sure thats going to make people scared have they actually asked afterwards are you more or less scared
93,lex fridman, thats a really good point thats a good summary of just humanity in general were attracted to creating cool stuff even though it can be dangerous
94,lisa randall, actually that was the really interesting thing about visiting that museum actually it was very nice because i had a tour from people who had been working there in the cold war and actually one or two people from the manhattan project it was a very cool tour you just realize just how just the thing itself gets you so excited
95,lisa randall, i think thats something sometimes these movies miss just the thing itself youre not thinking about the overall consequences in some ways it was like the early silicon valley people were just thinking what if we did this what if we did that not keeping track of what the peripheral consequences are you definitely see that happening with ai now i think that was the moral of the battle that just happened that its just full speed ahead
96,lex fridman, which gives me a really great transition to another quote in your book you write about the experience of facing the sublime in physics and you quote rainer rilke for beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror which we are still just able to endure and were so odd because its serenely disdains to annihilate us its pretty intense it i think applies to nuclear weapons
97,lisa randall, at a more mundane perhaps level i think it applies its really interesting one of the things that i found when i wrote these books is some people love certainty scientists many revel in uncertainty its not that you want to be uncertain you want to solve it but youre at this edge where its really frustrating because you dont really want to not know the answer but of course if you knew the answer it would be done
98,lisa randall, youre always at this edge where youre trying to sort things out and there is something scary you dont know if theres going to be a solution you dont know if youre going to find it its not something that can destroy the earth its just something that you do on your individual level but then of course there are much bigger things like the ones youre talking about where they could actually be dangerous the stuff i do i just want to be clear im doing theoretical physics not very dangerous but sometimes things end up having bigger consequences than you think
99,lex fridman, dangerous in a very pragmatic sense isnt it still in part terrifying when you think of just the size of things like the size of dark matter the power of this thing in terms of its potential gravitational effects just cosmological objects of a black hole at the center of our galaxy
100,lisa randall, this might be why im a physicist or why i differ from other people because im not such a big fan of humanity in some ways some ways i am but the idea that we were everything would be really boring to me i love the idea that theres so much more out there that theres a bigger universe and theres lots to discover and that were not all there is wouldnt it be disappointing if we were all there is
101,lex fridman, yeah and the full diversity of other stuff is pretty interesting
102,lisa randall, we have no idea how much there is we know what we can observe so far so the idea that theres other stuff out there that we yet have to figure out its exciting
103,lex fridman, let me ask you an out there question if you think of humans on earth life on earth as this pocket of complexity that emerged and theres a bunch of conditions that came to be and theres darwinian evolution and however life originated do you think its possible theres some pockets of complexity of that sort inside dark matter that we cant see
104,lisa randall, thats possible
105,lex fridman, chemistry and biology evolving in different ways
106,lisa randall, thats one of the reasons we suggest its not the reason but it would be true if there were the type of interactions wed suggest it would need more complex ones we dont know i will say that the conditions that give rise to life and complexity theyre complex theyre unlikely its not like theres great odds that would happen but theres no reason to know that it doesnt happen its worth investigating are there other forces that exist in the dark matter sector thats exactly
107,lex fridman, so the dark matter sector doesnt have all the forces of the standard model of physics
108,lisa randall, right as far as we know it doesnt have any it might have it at some low level but it could have its own forces just like the dark matter might not experience our light maybe it has its light that we dont experience
109,lex fridman, so there could be other kinds of forces
110,lisa randall, there could be other kinds of forces even within our sector that are too weak for us to have discovered so far or that exist at different scales than we know about we detect what interacts strongly enough with our detectors to detect its worth asking and thats one of the reasons we build big colliders to see are there other forces other particles that exist say at higher energies at shorter distance scales than weve explored so far its not just in the dark matter sector even in our sector there could be a whole bunch of stuff we dont yet know
111,lisa randall,particle physics
112,lex fridman, maybe lets zoom out and look at the standard model of particle physics how does dark matter fit into it first of all what is it can you explain what the standard model is
113,lisa randall, the standard model of particle physics is basically it tells us about natures most basic elements and their interactions its the substructure as far as we understand it if you look at atoms we know they have nuclei and electrons nuclei have protons and neutrons in them protons and neutrons have particles called quarks that are held together by something called the strong force
114,lisa randall, they interact through the strong force the strong nuclear force theres something called the weak nuclear force and electromagnetism basically all those particles and their interactions describe many many things we understand thats the standard model we now know about the higgs boson which is associated with how elementary particles get their mass that piece of the puzzle has also been completed
115,lisa randall, we also know that there are a weird array of masses of elementary particles theres not just the up and down quark but there are heavier versions of the up and down quark charm and strange top and bottom theres not just the electron theres a muon and a tau there are particles called neutrinos which are under intense study now which are partnered with the leptons through the weak interactions
116,lisa randall, we really do know these basic elements and we know the forces when were doing particle physics experiments we can usually even ignore gravity except in exceptional cases that we can talk about those are the basic elements in their interactions
117,lisa randall, dark matter stands outside that its not interacting through those forces when we look at the world around us we dont usually see the effects of dark matter its because theres so much of it that we do and it doesnt have those forces that we know about the standard model has worked spectacularly well its been tested to a high degree of precision people are still testing it
118,lisa randall, one of the things we do as physicists is we actually want it to break down at some level were looking for the precision measurement or the energy or whatever it will take where the standard model is no longer working not that its not working approximately but were looking for the deviations those deviations are critical because they can tell us what underlies the standard model which is what we really want to see next
119,lex fridman, where can you find the places where the standard model breaks down what are the places you can see those tiny little deviations
120,lisa randall, we dont know yet but we know the kinds of things you wouldnt want to look for one obvious place to look is at higher energy were looking at the large hadron collider but wed love to go beyond that higher energy means shorter distances and it means things that we just couldnt produce before emc so if you have a heavy particle and you dont have enough energy to make it youll never see it thats one place
121,lisa randall, the other place is precision measurements the standard model has been tested exquisitely so if its been tested  you want to look at a th of a percent there are some processes that we know shouldnt even happen at all in the standard model or happen at very suppressed level and those are other things that we look for all of those things could indicate theres something beyond what we know about which of course would be very exciting
122,lex fridman, when you just step back and look at the standard model the quarks and all the different particles and neutrinos isnt it wild how this little system came to be and underpins everything we see
123,lisa randall, absolutely thats why wed like to understand it better we want to know is it part of some bigger sector why are these particles why do they have the masses they do why is the higgs boson so light compared to the mass that could have had which we mightve even expected based on the principles of special relativity and quantum mechanics thats a really big question why are they what they are
124,lex fridman, and they originate theres some mechanism that created the whole thing
125,lisa randall, thats one of the things were trying to study why is it what it is
126,lex fridman, even just the mechanism that creates stuff the way a human being is created from a single cell its like embryogenesis the whole thing you build up this thing all of it this whole thing comes to be from just like a inaudible 
127,lisa randall, dont forget it is interacting with the environment
128,lex fridman, for sure okay right right right
129,lisa randall, its important
130,lex fridman, thats a really good question is how much of it is the environment is it just the environment acting on a set of constraints how much of it is just the information in the dna or any information how much is it in the initial conditions of the universe versus some other thing acting on it
131,lisa randall, these are big questions these are big questions in pretty much every field for the universe we do consider it its everything there is by definition but people now think about it is it one of many universes of course its a misnomer but could there be other places where there are selfcontained gravitational systems that we dont even interact with those are really important questions and the only way were going to answer them is we go back as far as we can we try to think theoretically and we try to think about observational consequences thats all we can do
132,lex fridman, one interesting way to explore the standard model is to look at your fun nuanced disagreement with carlo rovelli when you talked about him writing in his book electrons dont always exist they exist when they interact they materialize in a place when they collide with something else you wrote that ill just read the whole thing because its interesting
133,lex fridman, stocks may not achieve a precise value until theyre traded but that doesnt mean we cant approximate their worth until they change hands similarly electrons might not have definite properties but they do exist its true that the electron doesnt exist as a classical object with definite position until the position is measured but something was there  which physicists use a wave function to describe its a fascinating nuanced disagreement do electrons always exist or not does a tree fall in the forest if nobodys there to see it
134,lisa randall, i like to think of the universe as being out there whether or not it would be really weird if the only time things came into existence was when i saw them or i measured them
135,lex fridman, theres a lot of weird stuff in the works
136,lisa randall, i could believe that the middle east doesnt exist because im not there now that would be kind of ridiculous i think we would all agree on that i think theres only so much that we can attribute to our own powers of seeing the whole system doesnt come into being because im measuring it what is weird and this isnt even a disagreement about the standard model this is a disagreement about how you interpret quantum mechanics
137,lisa randall, i would say that those wave functions are real one of the things that dont forget that particle physics does that quantum field theory says is that electrons can be created and destroyed its not that every electron has to be in the universe thats what happens at colliders particles get created and destroyed but that doesnt mean that if i have electron in an atom its not there its certainly there and we know about it its charge is there
138,lex fridman, physics is a kind of way to see the world at the bottom whats the bottom turtle do you have a sense that theres a bottom reality that were trying to approximate with physics
139,lisa randall, i think we always have in our head maybe that wed like to find that but i have to i might not seem so but i think im more humble than a lot of physicists im not sure that were ever going to get to that bottom level but i do think were going to keep penetrating different layers and get further
140,lex fridman, i just wonder how far away we are
141,lisa randall, we all wonder that whats even the measure of how far away we are one way you can measure it is just by our everyday lives in terms of our everyday lives weve measured everything in terms of what underlies it theres a lot more to see part of it has to do with how far we think we can go it might be that the nature of reality changes so much that even these terms are different maybe the notion of distance itself might break down at some point
142,lex fridman, also to push back on the weve measured everything maybe theres stuff we havent even considered is measurable for example consciousness there might be stuff just like you said forces unseen undetected
143,lisa randall, its an interesting thing and this is often a confusion that happens theres the fundamental stuff underlying it and then theres the higher levels what well call an effective theory at some level were not always working when i throw a ball i dont tell you where every atom is i tell you theres a ball
144,lisa randall, there might be different layers of reality that are built in terms of the matter that we know about in terms of the stuff we know about that when i say weve measured everything i say that with a grain of salt i mean weve measured everything about the standard model theres lots of phenomena that we dont understand but often there are complex phenomena that will be given in terms of the fundamental ingredients that we know about
145,lex fridman, that is an interesting question because yes theres phenomena that are at the higher level of abstractions that emerge but maybe with consciousness there is far out people that think that consciousness is panpsychus that theres going to be almost like a fundamental force of physics thats consciousness that permeates all that matter
146,lisa randall, usually when you have a crazy sorry when you have a far out theory the thing you do is you test all the possibilities within the constructs that exist you dont just jump to the most far out possibility you can do that but then to see if its true you either have to find evidence of it or you have to show that its not possible without that and were very far from that
147,lex fridman, i think one of the criticisms of your theory on the dinosaurs was that it requires if i remember correctly for dark matter to be weirder than it already is i think you had a clever response to that can you remind
148,lisa randall, im not sure i remember what i said then but we have no idea how weird dark matter is its based on everyone thinking they know what dark matter is weirder than it already is its not already anything we dont know what it is so theres no normalization here
149,lex fridman, do we know if dark matter varies in density
150,lisa randall, it just certainly does in the universe just like for example theres more dark matter in galaxies than theres between galaxies it clumps its matter so its distributed like matter it is matter
151,lex fridman, it does clump but the full details of how it clumps and the complexity of the clumping
152,lisa randall, its understood pretty well people do simulations where people are always looking for things including us as particle physics its at small scales are the deviations on small scales so that indicating other interactions or other processes or interactions with baryons that is to say normal matter that we dont understand but on large scales we have a pretty good understanding of dark matter distribution
153,lex fridman, you were part of a recent debate on can science uncover reality let me ask you this question then what do you think is the limits of science
154,lisa randall, im smart enough to know that i have no idea also its not even clear what science means because theres the science that we do which is particle physics we try to find fundamental things and figure out what their effects are theres science like biology where at a higher level the kind of questions you ask are different the kind of measurements are different
155,lisa randall, the kind of science thats going to happen in the more numerical age or even ai what does it mean to answer a question does it mean that we can predict it does it mean that we can reproduce it i think were coming up against the definition of what we mean by science as human beings in terms of the science that we can do i dont think well know it until we get there were trying to solve hard problems and weve made progress
156,lisa randall, if you think of how much science has advanced in the last century or century and a half its incredible we didnt even know the universe was expanding at the beginning of the th century we didnt know about quantum mechanics at the beginning of the century we didnt know about special relativity thats a lot in a relatively short time depending on how you think of time i think it would be premature to say we know limitations
157,lex fridman, at various points throughout the history we thought we solved everything or at least various people declared
158,lisa randall, inaudible  various people exactly
159,lex fridman, declared that weve solved everything this also a good place to maybe could you describe the difference between topdown and bottomup approaches to theoretical physics that you talked about in the book
160,lisa randall, you could try to jump in and say i have a theory that i think is so perfect that i can predict everything from it or at least predict some salient features from it
161,lex fridman, mmhmm thats topdown
162,lisa randall, that would be a topdown bottomup is more like the questions we just asked why are masses what they are we measure things we want to put them together usually a good approach is to combine the two if you ask a very specific question but combine it with the methods of knowing that there could be a fundamental theory underlying it sometimes you make progress
163,lisa randall, the community tends to get segmented or fragmented into people who do one or the other but there are definitely times some of my best collaborations with people who are more topdown than i am so that we come up with interesting ideas that we wouldnt have thought of if either one of us was working individually
164,lex fridman, would you say the truly big leaps happened topdown like einstein
165,lisa randall, einstein was not a topdown person in the beginning special relativity was very much him thinking about they were thought experiments but he was very much the original theory about relativity is something like on the nature of electromagnetism he was trying to understand how maxwells laws could make sense when they seemed to have different symmetries than what we had thought they were
166,lisa randall, he was very much a bottomup person and in fact he resisted topdown for a long time then when he tried to do the theory of general relativity or the general theory of relativity whichever you want to call it incorporating gravity into the system when you need some feedback then he was helped by a mathematician who had developed some differential geometry and helped him figure out how to write down that
167,lisa randall, after that he thought topdown was the way to go but he actually didnt make that much progress i think its naive to think it was just one or the other in fact a lot of people who made real progress were rooted in actual measurements
168,lisa randall,physics vs mathematics
169,lex fridman, speaking of mathematicians what do you is the difference youve had a bit of foot in both between physics and mathematics in the way it helps us understand the world
170,lisa randall, to be frank theres a lot more overlap in physics and math i think that has been maybe not more but theres certainly a lot i think again the kinds of questions youre asking are usually different mathematicians like the structure itself physicists are trying to concentrate on to some extent on the consequences for the world but there is a lot of overlap
171,lex fridman, the string theory is an example theres certain theories where theres a certain mathematical beauty to it
172,lisa randall, theres also some really cool ideas that you get in particle physics where you can describe whats going on and connect it to other ideas thats also really beautiful i think basically insights can be beautiful they might seem simple and sometimes they genuinely are and sometimes theyre built on a whole system that you have to understand before if you actually saw einsteins equations written out in components if you wouldnt think its so beautiful if you write in a compact way it looks nice
173,lex fridman, what do you think about the successes and the failures of string theory to what degree do you think it succeeded to what degrees it not succeeded yet or has failed
174,lisa randall, i think to talk about any science in terms of success and failure often misses the point because theres not some absolute thing i do think that string theorists were a bit overly ambitious not overly ambitious but a little bit overly arrogant in the beginning thinking they could solve many problems that they werent going to solve
175,lisa randall, thats not to say the methods and advances in strength theory dont exist but they certainly werent able to immediately solve all the problems they thought they could solve it has given us tools it has given us some insights but it becomes almost a sociological question of how much it should be one or the other
176,lisa randall, i do think that you can get caught up in the problems themselves and sometimes you can get caught up in the methods and just do other examples the real physics insights often come from people who are thinking about physics as well as math
177,lex fridman, because you mentioned ai is there hope that ai might be able to help find some interesting insights another way to ask this question is how special are humans that were able to discover novel insights about the world
178,lisa randall, thats a great question and it depends on what kind of insights and what were going to find that out because its hard to think about something that doesnt quite exist yet i could just think about something take a step back its a little bit like im trying understand four dimensions so you go back to three dimensions go to something you can imagine
179,lisa randall, you can say a lot of the things in a very different level about the internet you could say has the internet helped do things it definitely took on a life of its own in some sense but its also something that were able to tame i know that i myself wouldnt have been able to write books if the internet didnt exist because i wouldnt have had the time to go to the library and look everything up it helped me enormously
180,lisa randall, in some sense ai could be that in a very nice world it could be a tool that helps us go a step further than we would and a lot more efficiently its already done that to some extent or it could be like the parts of the internet that we can control that are ruining politics or whatever theres certainly a lot of indications that can do that then there are even bigger things that people speculate about ai being able to do its own things but in terms of actually figuring things out were in the early stages
181,lex fridman, yeah theres several directions here one is on the theorem prover side wolfram alpha where everythings much more precise and we have large language model type of stuff one of the limitations of those is it seems to come up with convincing looking things which we dont know if its true or not and thats a big problem for physics
182,lisa randall, large language models are more or less generalizations of stuff that we have theres still breakthroughs in ai waiting to happen and maybe they are happening and maybe theyll be good maybe not but thats not quite the same maybe in some cases its just pattern recognition that leads to important things but sometimes it could be something more insightful than that that i cant even put my finger on
183,lisa randall, it forces us to we dont really understand how smart we are we dont understand how we think about things all that well actually but one thing is true though we are a lot more efficient right now than computers and coming up with things we require a lot less energy to do that if computers figure out how to do that then its going to be at a totally different ball game
184,lisa randall, here are clearly kinds of connections that we dont know how were making but we are making them thats going to be interesting i say were in early stages but this is changing very rapidly right now i dont think that its actually discovered new laws of physics but could it in the future maybe it can
185,lex fridman, it will raise big questions about what is special about humans that we dont quite appreciate there could be things that are like that leap of insight that happens truly novel ideas that could potentially be very difficult to do
186,lisa randall, there are abstract questions like that theres also questions of how is it that we can address to some extent how will ai be used in the context of the world we live in which is based on at least our countrys based on capitalism in a certain political system how will global politics deal with it how will our capitalist system deal with it what will be the things that we focus on doing with it how much will researchers get control of it to be able to ask different sorts of questions
187,lisa randall, while it was starting out people were doing these kinds of toy problems but what will it actually be applied to and what will it be optimized to do theres a lot of questions out there that its really important we start addressing
188,lex fridman, what to you is the most beautiful unsolved problem in physics and cosmology which is really exciting if we can unlock the mystery of in the next few decades
189,lisa randall, is it whats the most beautiful unsolved problem or what is the most beautiful unsolved problem i think we can make progress on
190,lex fridman, oh boy we make progress on in the next few centuries
191,lisa randall, most of the big questions have to do with what underlies things how things started whats at the base of it theres also just basic questions like that you asked earlier how far will science take us how much can we understand there are questions like how we got here what underlies it are there
192,lisa randall, also theres really deep questions like what fraction are we actually seeing if there are these other forces if there is another way of seeing the world are there universes beyond their own if theyre so totally different how do we even comprehend them what would we even think about them theres a lot about trying to get beyond its always just getting beyond our limited vision and limited experience and trying to see what underlies it both at small scales and at large scales
193,lisa randall, we just dont know the answers id like to think that we understand more about dark matter about dark energy about are there extra dimensions things that we actually work on but theres probably a lot beyond what we work on thats yet to be discovered
194,lex fridman, yeah understanding the extra dimensions piece will be really interesting
195,lisa randall, totally if it is how the universe went from higher dimensions to what we see are the extra dimensions present everywhere one of the really interesting pieces of physics we did that i talk about in my first book warped passages is finding out that there can be a higher dimension but only locally do you think theres a gravity of a lower dimension it could be like only locally do we think we live in three dimensions it could be higher dimensions is different
196,lisa randall, thats not actually the gravity we have but theres all sorts of phenomena that might be out there that we dont know about all sorts of evolution things time dependence that we dont know about of course thats from the point of view of particle physics from the point of view of other kinds of physics were just beginning so who knows
197,lex fridman, yeah if the physics changes throughout is not homogeneous throughout the universe thatll be weird
198,lisa randall, i mean for the observable universe its the same but beyond the observable universe who knows
199,lex fridman, youve had an exceptional career what advice would you give to young people maybe high school college on how to have a career they can be proud of and a life they can be proud of
200,lisa randall, i think the weird thing about being a scientist or an academic in general is you have to believe really strongly what you do while questioning it all the time thats a hard balance to have sometimes it helps to collaborate with people but to really believe that you could have good ideas at the same time knowing they could all be wrong thats a tough tightrope to walk sometimes but to really test them out
201,lisa randall, the other thing is sometimes if you get too far buried you look out and you think theres so much out there sometimes its just good to bring it back home and just think okay can i have as good idea as the person next to me rather than the greatest physicist who ever lived right now like you said i think theres lots of big issues out there and its hard to balance that
202,lisa randall, sometimes its hard to forget the role of physics but i think wilson said it really well when he said when they were building fermilab it was like this wont defend the country but itll make it worth defending its just the idea that in all this chaos its still important that we still make progress in these things sometimes when major world events are happening its easy to forget that i think those are important too you dont want to forget those but to try to keep that balance because we dont want to lose what it is that makes humans special
203,lex fridman, thats the big picture do you also lose yourself in the simple joy of puzzle solving
204,lisa randall, yeah we all like solving puzzles actually one of the things that drives me in my research is the inconsistencies when things dont make sense it really bugs me and it just will go into different directions to see how could these things fit together
205,lex fridman, it bugs you but that motivates you
206,lisa randall, yeah totally
207,lex fridman, until it doesnt you have to resolve it
208,lisa randall, i think i have this underlying belief that it should make sense even though the world comes at you in many ways and tells you nothing should make sense but if you believe that it makes sense and you look for underlying logic i think thats just good advice for everything to try to find why is it the way
209,lisa randall, i talk about effective theory in my second book knocking on heavens door a lot its rather than ask the big questions sometimes we just ask the questions about the immediate things that we can measure and like i said we can sometimes tell one that well fail but we can have these effective theories sometimes i think when we approach these big questions its good to do it from an effective theory point why do i find this satisfying why is the world we have the way it is
210,lisa randall, we think things are beautiful that we live in im not sure if we had different senses or different ways of looking at things we wouldnt necessarily find it beautiful but i have to say it is fantastic that no matter how many times i see a sunset i will always find it beautiful i dont think i ever see a sunset as say whatever its just always beautiful
211,lisa randall, there are things that as humans clearly resonate with us but we were maybe evolved that way but thats about us in terms of figuring out the universe its amazing how far weve gotten we have discovered many many wonderful things but theres a lot more out there and i hope we have the opportunity to keep going
212,lex fridman, with effective theories one small step at a time just keep unraveling the mystery
213,lisa randall, also having in mind the big questions but doing one small step at a time exactly
214,lex fridman, yeah looking out to the stars you said the sunset for me its the sunset the sunrise and just looking at the stars its wondering whats all out there and having a lot of hope that humans will figure it out
215,lisa randall, right i like it
216,lex fridman, lisa thank you for being one of the humans in the world for having me here for that are pushing it forward and figuring out this beautiful puzzle of ours thank you for talking today this was amazing
217,lisa randall, thank you for having me here
218,lex fridman, thanks for listening to this conversation with lisa randall to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description now let me leave you with some words from albert einstein the important thing is to not stop questioning curiosity has its own reason for existence thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
